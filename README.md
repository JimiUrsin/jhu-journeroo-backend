# Journeroo Backend
This is the back-end for my submission to the [Dev Academy Pre-assignment](https://github.com/solita/dev-academy-2023-exercise), implemented in Kotlin. Please see https://github.com/JimiUrsin/jhu-journeroo-frontend for the actual README of this project.

## How to operate
This part isn't supposed to be used manually, the front-end part of the application will make the requests to this back-end. However, if you would like to take a look at the raw data that the application gives out, you can visit https://jhu-journeroo-backend.fly.dev/api/journeys/ where the app is deployed.
